# ShoppingApp



# ShoppingApp is an application with a simple interface and basic functions.

# It was developed using the Swift programming language, and the MVVM architecture was preferred.

# Developed using Platzi Fake Store API based on OpenAPI specification. https://api.escuelajs.co/docs
# Snapkit, Alamofire and Kingfisher were used as 3rd party libraries in the project.

## Note: Due to the absence of stock data in the API content, static data has been used for product stock quantities.
